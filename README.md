My Personal Expo-Router Boilerplate

When I start any expo project, most of the initial structures and libaries which need to be install and code are always same, so to make it less time consuming and easy. I create this boilerplate.

```git clone https://github.com/kaissaroj/expo-router-boilerplate.git <project_name>```
